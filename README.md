# Implementation of Neural Networks from scratch

1. This repository contains detailed code to implement neural network training using only numpy and scipy.
2. I followed Dr Simon Prince's [Understanding Deep Learning](https://udlbook.github.io/udlbook/) book to code it.
3. I have also included some equations as comments for better understanding of the code.
4. There is test_nn.py file to test the functions that I wrote.
5. Fork the repository and feel free to change it and improvise it.
6. To run the code create a virtual environment, install the requirements.txt and run nn.py
   ```
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python nn.py
   ```
